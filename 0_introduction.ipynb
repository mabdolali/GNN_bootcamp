    "Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) was a city from the old Kingdom of Prussia spanning along both sides of the Pregel river. The city had two islands that were connected to the mainland through bridges. The smaller island was connected with two bridges to either side of the river, while the bigger island was connected with only one. Additionally, there was one bridge connecting both islands. \n",

    " Imagine that you are a tourist and want to cross *all 7 bridges* because they are the main attraction of the city. However, you are a bit lazy and do not want to walk too much. So, you do not want to cross the same bridge more than one time. Is there a path through the city that does this? *No  matter how many paths you try, you will not find a solution!*\n",

    "Leonhard Euler, a famous  mathematician, realized this, and explained why it was impossible to make this path through the city. \n",
    "He realized the only important part to consider for the problem was the connections between the different landmasses. He drew dots to represent the landmasses and lines connecting these dots to represent the bridges. The location of the dots and the shape of the lines are not relevant for the problem, only their relation. In the end, he had an abstraction of the problem with only dots and lines, which  is now called a graph.\n",

    "\n",
    "He thought that in order to walk through a landmass you need to enter through a bridge and exit from a different bridge. This means that the dot representing that landmass needs two lines connecting it to represent the enter and exit line. More generally, the dot can have any even number of lines as connections. This does not necessarily apply for two dots, which are the first and last landmass in the path. This proves that it is impossible to make a path that crosses through all bridges.\n",
    "By abstracting the problem, Euler started the field of graph theory and his solution became the first theorem of this field."

    "\n",
    " #### Graph-level task:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a graph-level task, our goal is to predict the property of an entire graph. For example, for a molecule represented as a graph, we might want to predict what the molecule smells like, or whether it will bind to a receptor implicated in a disease. This is analogous to image classification problems with MNIST and CIFAR, where we want to associate a label to an entire image. With text, a similar problem is sentiment analysis where we want to identify the mood or emotion of an entire sentence at once.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Node-level task:\n",
    "\n",
    "Node-level tasks are concerned with predicting the identity or role of each node within a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic example of a node-level prediction problem is Zach’s karate club.\n",
    "The dataset is a single social network graph made up of individuals that have sworn allegiance to one of two karate clubs after a political rift. As the story goes, a feud between Mr. Hi (Instructor) and John H (Administrator) creates a schism in the karate club. The nodes represent individual karate practitioners, and the edges represent interactions between these members outside of karate. The prediction problem is to classify whether a given member becomes loyal to either Mr. Hi or John H, after the feud. In this case, distance between a node to either the Instructor or Administrator is highly correlated to this label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the image analogy, node-level prediction problems are analogous to image segmentation, where we are trying to label the role of each pixel in an image. With text, a similar task would be predicting the parts-of-speech of each word in a sentence (e.g. noun, verb, adverb, etc).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Edge-level task:\n",
    "\n",
    "One example of edge-level inference is in image scene understanding. Beyond identifying objects in an image, deep learning models can be used to predict the relationship between them. We can phrase this as an edge-level classification: given nodes that represent the objects in the image, we wish to predict which of these nodes share an edge or what the value of that edge is. If we wish to discover connections between entities, we could consider the graph fully connected and based on their predicted value prune edges to arrive at a sparse graph.\n",
