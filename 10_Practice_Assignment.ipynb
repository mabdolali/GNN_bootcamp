    "### Hands-on Practice: Implementing a GCN on the Karate Club Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: In this session, you'll work with a variant of the Karate Club dataset, featuring 4 classes, to implement a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) using PyTorch Geometric.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the Karate Club Dataset (4 Classes):\n",
    "The Karate Club dataset represents the social interactions between 34 members of a university karate club. Originally, the dataset is famous for showing how the club eventually split into two factions due to a conflict between the clubâ€™s instructor and administrator. However, in this version, the dataset is partitioned into **4 distinct classes**, representing finer subdivisions of the members based on their community structure within the club.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Structure:\n",
    "- **34 nodes**: Each node corresponds to a club member.\n",
    "- **78 edges**: Edges represent friendships between members based on social interactions.\n",
    "- **4 classes**: The nodes are classified into 4 distinct communities, which reflect a more detailed subdivision of the original two factions."
