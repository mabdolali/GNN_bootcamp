Each observation is a tuple of the form *(event, event type,timestamp)* where *event type* can be a node or edge addition, node or edge deletion, node feature update, etc. *event* represents the actual event that happened, and *timestamp* is the time at which the event occured:\n",

    "## combining GNNs with sequence models\n",
    "\n",
    "DTDGs are made up of several snapshots arranged in order over time, which can be treated as sequential data. Temporal patterns in DTDGs are identified by looking at the relationships between these snapshots. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often combined with GNNs to create dynamic models for DTDGs. These combinations are generally grouped into two types: stacked architectures and integrated architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stacked dynamic GNNs:** The most straightforward way to model a discrete dynamic graph is to have a separate GNN handle each snapshot of the graph and feed the output of each GNN to a time series component, such as an RNN. This is illustrated in the following Figure: \n",

    "One of most well-known approaches in this cateogry is Waterfall Dynamic-GCN. In this architectures, a GCN is stacked with an LSTM per node. More specifically, at first separate GCNs (with same parameters) handle each snapshot of the graph and next the output of each GNN is sequentially given to a LSTM. In fact, a separate LSTM is used per node (although the weights across the LSTMs are shared). The architecture is illustaretd in the following Figure:\n",

    "The final fully-coonected (FC) layer produces the $C$-class probability vector for each nodes of every snapshot of the sequence. This layer, which produces the $C$-class probability vector for each node and for each instant of the sequence, can be seen as 5 x 4 copies of a FC layer.\n",
