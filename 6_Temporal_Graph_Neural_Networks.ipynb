    "DTDGs are made up of several snapshots arranged in order over time, which can be treated as sequential data. Temporal patterns in DTDGs are identified by looking at the relationships between these snapshots. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often combined with GNNs to create dynamic models for DTDGs. These combinations are generally grouped into two types: stacked architectures and integrated architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stacked dynamic GNNs:** The most straightforward way to model a discrete dynamic graph is to have a separate GNN handle each snapshot of the graph and feed the output of each GNN to a time series component, such as an RNN. This is illustrated in the following Figure: \n",

    "One of most well-known approaches in this cateogry is Waterfall Dynamic-GCN. In this architectures, a GCN is stacked with an LSTM per node. More specifically, at first separate GCNs (with same parameters) handle each snapshot of the graph and next the output of each GNN is sequentially given to a LSTM. In fact, a separate LSTM is used per node (although the weights across the LSTMs are shared). The architecture is illustaretd in the following Figure:\n",

    "The final fully-coonected (FC) layer produces the $C$-class probability vector for each nodes of every snapshot of the sequence. This layer, which produces the $C$-class probability vector for each node and for each instant of the sequence, can be seen as 5 x 4 copies of a FC layer.\n",

    "One major break-through approach in this category is <i>**EvolveGCN**</i>. <u>EvolveGCN applies Temporal neural networks such as RNNs to the *GCN parameters* themselves.</u> Note that GCN parameters are considered temporal and not the embeddings.

    "### Example: Using Temporal Graphs for Action based recognition in Pytorch\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Skeleton-based action recognition leverages human skeletal data to identify and classify actions or gestures. This approach is particularly effective because skeleton data provides a structured and abstract representation of body movements, capturing key joint positions and their interactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/skeleton_as_graph.png\" width=\"300\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Skeleton Data: The input consists of sequences of joint positions, typically represented as a set of coordinates for each joint in a human skeleton. Each joint's position is recorded over time, creating a sequence of frames that shows how the skeleton moves.\n",
    "- Graph Representation: In the graph-based approach, each joint is treated as a node in a graph, and edges represent the connections between joints (e.g., bones). This graph captures the spatial relationships and constraints between different parts of the body.\n",
    "- Spatio-Temporal Modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Spatial Analysis: To analyze the spatial relationships between joints, graph convolutional layers are used. These layers capture how the joints interact with each other within a single frame.\n",
    "    - Temporal Analysis: To understand how these interactions change over time, temporal convolutional layers process sequences of frames. This helps in learning the dynamic patterns of movement across time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCNs) are a pioneering approach designed to handle data that involves both spatial and temporal dimensions, particularly suited for tasks like action recognition from skeleton data. \n",
    "In ST-GCNs, skeleton data is represented as a graph where joints (body parts) are nodes and their connections (bones) are edges. This graph structure captures the spatial relationships between different joints in a single frame.\n",
    "ST-GCNs are composed of several layers. In each layer, ST-GCNs use GCN to apply convolution operations on the graph structure, aggregating information from neighboring nodes (joints) to learn how each joint's position relates to others. This helps in capturing the spatial patterns of body movements. Since actions involve sequences of movements over time, ST-GCNs also include one-dimensional temporal convolutional layers. These layers process sequences of frames, allowing the model to learn how the spatial configuration of joints changes over time. Temporal convolutions help capture dynamic patterns and transitions in the motion data. The overall procedure of applying several layers of STGCN is shown below:\n",
