    "Temporal graphs can be divided in two categories:\n",
    "- **Static graphs with temporal signals:** The underlying graph structure does not change over time, but features and labels evolve over time.\n",

    "A main example is for traffic forcasting where graphs are based on traffic sensor data (e.g. the PeMS dataset) where each sensor is a node, and the edges are road connections. The geographical distribution of sensors in PeMS is shown below:\n",

    "A main example is in a social network where new edges are added when people make new friends, existing edges are removed when people stop being friends, and node features change as people change their attributes, e.g., when they change their career assuming that career is one of the node features.\n",
